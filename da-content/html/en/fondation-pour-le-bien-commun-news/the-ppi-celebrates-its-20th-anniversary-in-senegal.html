<p>To mark the 20th anniversary of the PPI and the end of its sixth phase, more than 80 participants from associations and institutions gathered in Toubacouta, in the heart of the Saloum Delta Biosphere Reserve in Senegal, for the second edition of the PPI Exchange Forum. This event, co-organised with the Nebeday association, a long-standing partner of the programme, aimed to promote the sharing of experience and expertise between local organisations on biodiversity conservation in West and Central Africa. Ten years after the first PPI Forum in Limbé, Cameroon, this new meeting also aimed to consolidate and demonstrate the dynamism of the PPI "community", while promoting synergies between players committed to the environment.</p>

With its 180,000 hectares, it offers a unique setting.</p><p>Hosted by the Nebeday organisation at its "nature camp" in Soucouta, near Toubacouta, the participants had the opportunity to discover this exceptionally rich ecosystem of the Sine Saloum delta, combining mangroves, savannahs, mudflats and dry forests.</p><p>It was an opportunity to visit the galagos at night, take birdwatching trips in a dug-out canoe, and visit local initiatives run by Nebeday. This organisation is particularly active in the management of community protected areas in Senegal and the development of green industries such as the production of bissap, honey and moringa.</p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>A participatory forum, as close as possible to the concerns of those working in the field, for a consolidated PPI network</strong></p>
<p>The forum brought together 51 PPI partner organisations from 19 countries in West and Central Africa, as well as four institutional and financial partners, including the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, the Audemars Piguet Foundation for Trees, the <a href="https://audemars-watkins.foundation/">Audemars-Watkins Foundation</a> and the French Global Environment Facility. Members of the IUCN Mediterranean PPI OSCAN programme were also present to take part in the discussions and report on the challenges of conserving biodiversity in North Africa.</p>
<p>One of the great strengths of this forum was its participatory approach, with participants themselves able to propose and select the themes and issues they wished to discuss. Nearly 100 topics were proposed, and 33 were selected by the NGOs, on themes such as governance and citizen participation, ecological monitoring, the creation and management of protected areas, and community life and the strengthening of organisations. Over the course of the 30 thematic sessions, discussions were structured around participative workshops, round tables, debates and site visits.</p>
<p>Thanks to this interactive and inclusive format, the sessions responded directly to the concrete concerns of the participants, in relation to the projects implemented on the ground: How to create a community protected area? Why and how should ecotourism activities be developed? How can new technologies improve the monitoring of species and their habitats? How important is it to integrate gender issues into conservation projects?</p>
<p>The forum also focused on "organisational" issues that are essential for strengthening NGOs, such as strategic planning, developing a communications strategy, writing grant applications and the importance of well-being in the workplace.</p>
<p>The presence of media outlets throughout the week, such as RFI, with journalist Anne-Cécile Bras, also provided an opportunity to showcase the expertise of PPI partners. The journalist produced two programmes for "C’est pas du Vent", looking at the progress of some PPI organisations and the innovative initiatives they are implementing to manage natural resources in their areas. Two programmes that illustrate the many fascinating discussions that took place during the PPI Forum!</p>

<p><strong>A springboard for new collaborations</strong></p>
<p>The forum was an excellent opportunity for the partners to forge links, strengthen their collaboration, exchange best practice and learn more about a wide range of practical issues.</p>
<p>By creating such a dynamic, the week highlighted the strength of the PPI network, which continues to play an essential role in protecting ecosystems and developing local communities, drawing on the commitment and expertise of local organisations.</p>
