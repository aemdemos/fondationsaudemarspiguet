<h1 id="new-forest-reserve-in-the-parc-naturel-du-jorat">New forest reserve in the Parc naturel du Jorat</h1>
<p>The State of Vaud and the City of Lausanne recently signed an agreement establishing a natural forest reserve of almost 450 hectares in the heart of the Parc naturel du Jorat, the first peri-urban park in French-speaking Switzerland.</p>
<p>The 50-year agreement should enable the natural processes essential to the development of numerous plant and animal species, as well as the forest ecosystem, to be re-established.<br>
<br>
Recognised as a site of national importance since 2021 for the crucial role it plays in conserving biodiversity and studying ecosystems, the Parc naturel du Jorat is a jewel of the Swiss Plateau that welcomes thousands of visitors every year. New signage indicating the rules to be observed when visiting this protected area has been installed at the park’s various entry points.<br>
<br>
Since 2021, the Audemars Piguet Foundation for Trees has been helping to finance the development of educational facilities in the Parc naturel du Jorat. The project it is supporting ambitions in particular to consolidate and enhance the infrastructure aimed at visitors, including people with reduced mobility and schoolchildren. It comprises the creation of a reception area and the setup of themed learning trails designed per school level in accordance with the local educational curriculum, the Plan d’études romand.<br>
<br>
