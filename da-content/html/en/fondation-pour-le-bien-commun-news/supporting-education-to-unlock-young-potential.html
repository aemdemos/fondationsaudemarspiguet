<p>Under the auspices of the Audemars Piguet Foundations, Audemars Piguet organised two auctions in 2023 as part of their continuing commitment to create value and positive impact as a responsible, uncompromising, and visionary company.</p>

Act. Change our World" programme to benefit 750,000 young people in the United States. In May 2023, there was a second sale in Dubai with the one-of-a-kind Royal Oak Concept Tourbillon "Black Suit Spider-Man" as the main lot. It raised a record $ 8.5 million which will be donated to two charities, First Book and Ashoka, to continue empowering young people (aged five to 18) from vulnerable communities to become agents of change. This new programme element, which includes collaboration with the international organisation Teach for All, will expand the initiative to other countries, including Brazil, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Canada.</div></div></div>

<p>A further auction was held in Tokyo in August 2023. It featured a unique 41 mm Royal Oak Automatic Chronograph model, created in collaboration with the American designer Matthew Williams, founder of the 1017 ALYX 9SM brand. The sale raised $ 1.5 million for Right to Play and Kids in Motion programmes and capacity building. Active in the field of play-based learning, the two NGOs are dedicated to training and empowering disadvantaged youth in East Africa.<br>
<br>
The international organisation Right to Play has already reached more than 2.78 million children in 15 countries. The proceeds from this sale will enable it to consolidate its actions, particularly in Tanzania and Uganda, where Right to Play has already positively impacted the lives of more than 100,000 children.</p>

<p>Kids in Motion, which Williams has supported for several years, will dedicate the funds raised to a project in Lamu, Kenya. This donation will help strengthen the infrastructure of the Mwendo Bora campus and support play and sports activities offered within the school.<br>
<br>
These projects will be monitored by the Audemars Piguet Foundations for the next five years.</p>
