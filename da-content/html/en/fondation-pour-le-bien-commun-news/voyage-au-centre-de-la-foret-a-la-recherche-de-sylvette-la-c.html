<h1 id="journey-to-the-centre-of-the-forest-searching-for-sylvette-the-owl">Journey to the centre of the forest: searching for Sylvette the owl</h1>
<p>A new educational forest trail was inaugurated in Grimentz this summer. Developed with the support of the Audemars Piguet Foundation for Trees, the project is the result of a partnership between the Association forestière des propriétaires de forêt du Valais central (the Central Valais Forest Owners’ Association), Anniviers Tourisme, and Forêt Valais.</p>
<p>This trail, consisting of 11 stations made of local wood, invites visitors of all ages to explore the issues surrounding the forest and its importance for the Alpine ecosystem. Attractions include a giant memory game, quizzes, and a variety of other interactive games. At each station, families can learn while having fun with Sylvette, the charming little owl who is the trail’s mascot. The activity takes a playful approach to raising public awareness of the forest, its purpose, its fauna and flora, and the jobs associated with it. The themes covered range from the history of the forest to climate change, the animal world, natural hazards, and the production of local wood.<br>
<br>
Entirely designed by the region’s forestry services, this initiative promises an immersive and educational experience, highlighting the crucial role of forests in the canton of Valais. Visitors are invited to explore the educational trail at their own pace and enjoy the games at any time.<br>
<br>
Installed in the heart of the Îlot Bosquet forest in Grimentz until 31 October 2024, the trail, which is easily dismantled, will be relocated elsewhere in the canton next year to reach a wider audience.</p>
