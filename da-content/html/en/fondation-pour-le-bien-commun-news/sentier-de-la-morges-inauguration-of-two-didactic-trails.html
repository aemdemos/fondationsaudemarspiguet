<p>On Friday May 3, the Association pour la sauvegarde de Morges inaugurated two didactic trails linking Morges and Vaux-sur-Morges.</p>
<p>Called "From stone to castle" and "From water to mills", the trails are both punctuated by themed stations offering observation activities and missions to get to the next station. This educational approach, based on games and sensory experiences, is designed to raise awareness among families and pupils of the richness of the Morges valley, respect for its flora and fauna, and the challenges of sustainability. The trails are compatible with the <em>Plan d’études romand</em> (curriculum of the French-speaking part of Switzerland) and are complemented by an educational pack available on the association's website.<br>
<br>
The creation of these two trails was part of a larger project to secure and extend the Sentier de la Morges, which began in 2022 with the support of the Audemars Piguet Foundation for Trees. Today, the path offers 4.5 km of walks, during which visitors learn to observe and recognise the natural and landscape features of the area, while discovering the stories that make it special, such as those of the mills, the Morges mineral waters and the Vufflens Castle.</p>
